/**
 * Microsoft Teams specific join logic
 *
 * Teams v2 (New Teams) — Classic Teams (/_#/ URLs) was retired July 1, 2025.
 *
 * The correct approach for new Teams (confirmed working via ScreenApp's
 * open-source meeting bot, production 2026):
 *
 * 1. Navigate directly to the original meeting URL (no URL rewriting)
 *    - /meet/ID?p=TOKEN (short format)
 *    - /l/meetup-join/... (long format)
 *
 * 2. Teams shows a launcher page. Click "Continue on this browser" with force:true
 *    - Use multiple button selectors (aria-label variations)
 *    - The button DOES work when clicked with force:true in headed Playwright
 *
 * 3. Wait for the pre-join screen (up to 120s)
 *    - Look for data-tid="prejoin-display-name-input" (name field)
 *    - This is the reliable indicator we're past the launcher
 *
 * 4. Fill name, toggle devices, click "Join now"
 *
 * Key requirements:
 *   - Headed mode (headless: false) — Teams requires it
 *   - StealthPlugin or anti-detection measures
 *   - Linux X11 user agent (Chrome/135 on X11; Linux x86_64)
 *   - --kiosk --start-maximized flags for Teams
 *   - --use-fake-ui-for-media-stream --use-fake-device-for-media-stream
 *   - force:true on launcher button click
 *   - Long timeout (120s) for pre-join screen to load
